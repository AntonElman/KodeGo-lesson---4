        <h1>KodeGo Exercise 4</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Heading define the outline of our webpage. There are six levels of headings.</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>This is how we make an unordered list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element(it stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element.</li>
            <li>The don't need to be in any particular order.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ordered/Numbered Lists</h2>
        <p>This is how we make an ordered list.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrappping everything?</li>
            <li>But, the list item elements are the same.</li>
            <li>Also note the numbers increment on their own.</li>
            <li>We should be noticing things in precise order because this is an ordered list.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, we need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
        <p>Other times, we need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        <p>Thanks for reading! Learning HTML should be getting easier now.
